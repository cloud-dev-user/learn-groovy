Explanation:

pipeline: Begins the definition of the pipeline.
agent any: Specifies that the pipeline can run on any available agent.
stages: Defines the different stages of the pipeline.
Each stage block represents a distinct phase of the CI/CD process (e.g., checkout, build, test, deploy).
steps: Contains the actual commands to be executed within each stage.
environment: Sets environment variables for use within the stage.
post: Defines post-build actions based on the outcome of the pipeline.
success: Executes specific actions when the pipeline succeeds.
failure: Executes specific actions when the pipeline fails.



The pipeline starts by defining parameters, allowing the user to select the deployment environment.
Stages include checkout, build, unit testing, and parallel integration testing with database and API tests.
The deployment stage only runs for staging and production environments, determined by the value of the ENVIRONMENT parameter.
Post-build actions send notifications via Slack, indicating the success or failure of the pipeline.
Custom methods deployToStaging() and deployToProduction() handle deployment to respective environments based on conditions.
This example showcases a more comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with parameterization, parallel execution, conditional deployment, and notification integration, suitable for complex project requirements.


Error Handling: Added try-catch blocks to catch exceptions during the build, test, and deployment stages. If an error occurs, it sets the build result to 'FAILURE' and throws an error message.

Environment Configuration: Set the MAVEN_HOME environment variable to the path of the Maven tool installed on the Jenkins agent. This ensures that Maven is available in the pipeline environment for building the project.

Clean Workspace: Added the cleanWs() function to clean up the workspace after the pipeline completes, ensuring a clean environment for subsequent builds.
